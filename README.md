# Curated list of JavaCard applications
The goal is to provide curated catalog of all open-source JavaCard applets and applications relevant for JavaCard development. The initial list was compiled by complete search for all GitHub and SourceForge repositories with *'javacard.framework'* keyword.

You are encouraged to contribute - please create a pull request. 

The projects collected in this list were analyzed and published (June 2017) in [Analysis of JavaCard open-source ecosystem](https://medium.com/enigma-shards/analysis-of-javacard-open-source-ecosystem-9be0bfd66398)

## Backup of listed repositories
As repositores are sometimes moved or removed, the fork of each repository under the virtual organization ['javacard-curated-list'](https://github.com/javacard-FOSS-applets) is created. Try to find a repository there if link doesn't work.

### Format and notation
> **Project name _[status : activity]_** <br> Short description, often taken from a project readme.md

The main goal of this framework is to synchronize Java Card 2 applets through the exchange of ciphered APDUs. The current state of the framework is lacking in many ways and requires more works to be fully functional. However it can serve as a proof of concept for the synchronization of applet data in a secure fashion in a pure Java Card 2 setting (i.e.: without tweaking the Java Card VM).
